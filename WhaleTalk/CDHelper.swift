Instances of NSManagedObjectContext use a coordinator to save object graphs to persistent storage and to retrieve model information. A context without a coordinator is not fully functional as it cannot access a model except through a coordinator. The coordinator is designed to present a façade to the managed object contexts such that a group of persistent stores appears as an aggregate store. A managed object context can then create an object graph based on the union of all the data stores the coordinator covers.

We work with it upon initialization, but we almost never touch it again over the life of the application.
